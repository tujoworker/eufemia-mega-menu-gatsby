## A MegaMenu

This MegaMenu (MainMenu) works both as a static page (SSR pre-rendered HTML) and inside a Modal (Drawer).

The advantages of using the [Eufemia Drawer](https://eufemia.dnb.no/uilib/components/modal/demos#drawer-mode) is the fact that it disables all app interaction possibilities for both keyboard users and screen readers, as well as disabling scrolling for touch users. Except for the content inside the Drawer - for sure!
